# UWP-Circle-Button-Style-
A perfect circlular button which has a round highlight while hovering over it too. Posted here because there was no help for this on the internet.
Go ahead and fork, make it your own :)

<h2>How to use this style</h2>

You can either add the style in between resources tags like this: <Grid.Resources> (Put Style here) </Grid.Resources>

Or you can add it directly into the Style tags of a button (In order for this to work, you need to remove the x:Key attribute) :
 <Button>
  <Button.Style>
   (Put Style here)
  </Button.Style>
 </Button>
 
 
 <b>Note</b>: Whenever you see "(put style here)", literally copy and paste the style from the xaml file in there.
